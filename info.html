<h2>Meter Beater</h2>
<p>
Parking tickets have become a part driving downtown Toronto, everyone gets them eventually. With Meter Beater, tickets are now only for the uninformed. The map produced in Meter Beater is built using predictive models of actual historic tickets issued - this map isn't built according to the rules, it's built according to the _enforcement_ of the rules. Dodge that meter maid.

<p>
Data is based on parking tickets issued within the political boundary of Toronto since the beginning of 2008. Around 2.7 million tickets are issued each year to the half a million addresses in Toronto. My apartment building alone makes the City of Toronto near $2000 dollars each year in $30 parking tickets.</p>

A few caveats:
<ul>
<li>My software is only as good as the data, though it's pretty good and getting better. </li>
<li>If you are the first person to get a ticket at a location for a particular date/time, there isn't much I could have done to predict that. Parking on the highway for example. It's still up to you to make sure you double check the signs and the meters.</li>
<li>Tickets are issued to an specific address.  Large buildings can minorly obfuscate the data.</li>
<li>If you find a situation where I'm not reporting accurately (I haven't been able to explore the entire city after all) let me know and I'll do my best to fix it. </li>
</ul>

<p>Go easy on me, this is my first iOS app.</p>
