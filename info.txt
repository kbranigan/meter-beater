Parking tickets have become a part driving downtown Toronto; everyone gets them eventually.  With Meter Beater, tickets are now only for the uninformed.  The map produced in Meter Beater is built using predictive models of actual historic tickets issued - this map isn't built according to the rules, it's built according to the _enforcement_ of the rules.  Dodge that meter maid.

Data is based on parking tickets issued within the political boundary of Toronto since the beginning of 2008.  Around 2.7 million tickets are issued each year to the half a million addresses in Toronto.  My apartment building makes the City of Toronto around 1.5 thousand dollars each year in 30-50$ parking tickets, which I suppose isn't such a big deal actually.

A few caveats:
– My software is only as good as the data, though it's pretty good and getting better.
– If you are the first person to get a ticket at a location for a particular date/time, there isn't much I could have done to predict that.  Parking on the highway for example.  It's still up to you to make sure you double check the signs and the meters.
– If you find a situation where I'm not reporting accurately (I haven't been able to explore the entire city after all) let me know and I'll do my best to fix it.
– Go easy on me, it's my first iOS app.

===========

Ever run in to drop off your dry cleaning, only to come back to a $50 parking ticket? What were the chances the meter maids would be coming by right then?

Enter Meter Beater.

Meter Beater uses state-of-the-art computer modelling to answer the age-old question: "Should I chance it?" 

One look at Meter Beater, and you'll know whether you're in the clear or if you're parking in what Kenny Loggins calls The Danger Zone.


DISCLAIMER:

Some spots get ticketed all the time, while others get ticketed only very occasionally. While using Meter Beater will help you avoid the hot spots, you can still get a ticket anywhere parking is illegal.
